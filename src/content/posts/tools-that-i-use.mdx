## "Tell me, what tools do you use?"

This question came up during a recent interview, and I was caught off guard by it! While I had thoroughly prepared for the interview by focusing on typical interview questions, this wasn't one I had anticipated. Caught in the moment, I could only name about five tools off the top of my head and brushed it off, not recognizing the question's significance.

However, upon reflecting after the interview (especially since I didn't get the job), I realized how insightful the question truly was. It was an opportunity to demonstrate not only my efficiency as a developer but also my openness to learning and integrating new tools to improve my workflow. By dismissing it, I missed a chance to show my resourcefulness and adaptability.

In hindsight, I've categorized my tools into six key areasâ€”Terminal, VS Code, JavaScript, CSS, SVG Editing and Learning. Each of these categories highlights a suite of tools that I rely on regularly to optimize my work, with brief explanations on their relevance and benefits.

### Terminal Tools (CLI)
*	<strong>Warp</strong> - Fun terminal alternative with lots of options to configure 
*	<strong>oh-my-zsh</strong> - can't say enough about this brilliant library: npm, git web search and more alias's that enable almost full control from your terminal
*	<strong>Node</strong> - do I need to comment on this? LOL
*	<strong>npm, pnpm</strong> - same as above
* <strong>Amazon Q</strong> - if you haven't looked into this helper, you must! One example; when pushing branches up where you can't remember the exact name you gave it ðŸ˜‚
* <strong>Git</strong> 
### [The Mighty] VS Code IDE. Tools (although a tool itself!)
* <strong>Prettier</strong> - extension
* <strong>Emmet</strong> - extension
* <strong>Quokka.js</strong> - oh I love this one for JavaScript feedback!
* <strong>Codiem</strong> - like CoPilot but free
* <strong>TailwindCSS IntelliSense</strong> - extension. Priceless for the multiplicity of Tailwind's utility classes
* <strong>Better Comments</strong> - extension
* <strong>Auto close tag</strong> - extension
* <strong>Advanced New File</strong> - extensio. Now this one saves a bundle of time in creating new files, new folders. Highly recommended. <span class="link__color">[Here &rsaquo;](https://github.com/dkundel/vscode-new-file)</span>
* <strong>Expand region</strong> - extension
* <strong>Jumpy</strong> - extension. Now this GEM at a key combo of `cmd + j` will place multiple tiny (line-height) circles with two alphabetic characters set against a small white circular background. You then press the 2 characters and your cursor jumps exactly to that spot. Saves clicking!  <span class="link__color">[Here &rsaquo;](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnpyp.vscode-jumpy-plus)</span>
* <strong>Live Server</strong> - extension. Real valuable for quick server spin-up.
* <strong>Markdown Preview</strong> - extension. Quick view as you add content to your markdown file.
* <strong>MDX Support</strong> - extension
* <strong>HTML CSS Support</strong> - extension
* <strong>Text pastry</strong> - extension
* <strong>Waka Time</strong> - extension. This is great for feedback on recording the actual amount of time you spent on each language, project even machine! Very configurable.
### JavaScript
* <strong>Quokka.js</strong> - mentioned above
* <strong>ES7 & React/Redux/React-Native/JS snippets</strong> - VS Code extension
* <strong>Strict mode</strong>
### CSS, CSS3
* <strong>SCSS (SASS)</strong>
* <strong>OpenProps</strong>
* <strong>TailwindCSS</strong> One of my strengths. Please see my article on it <span class="link__color">[here &rsaquo;](https://py-chapman.netlify.app/blog/tailwind-integration/`)</span>
* <strong>PostCSS</strong> & PostCSS Language Support (VS Code extension)
### SVG Editing
* <strong>Adobe Illustrator</strong> The industry standard.
* <strong>SVG Viewer</strong> Very handy online viewer that you paste your code into with the ability to instantly view changes. <span class="link__color">[Link here &rsaquo;](https://www.svgviewer.dev/)</span>
### Learning
* <strong>Udemy.com</strong> I particularly favor Maximilian SchwarzmÃ¼ller's courses on JavaScript, React and TypeScript. 
* <strong>YouTube</strong>
* <strong>Coding In Public</strong> Chris Pennington's a great resource for Astro and other helpful tips.

Well... that's about it! I'm sure there are a few that I may have missed listing but these are the workhorses that help me do what I do best. It's exciting to see a new, well thought-out tool come out - anything that lightens the drudgery of repititive tasks opens the creativity faucet! ðŸš°
