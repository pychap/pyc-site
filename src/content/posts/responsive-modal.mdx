## Building a modal with multiple functional requirements
### Requirements

UX and Product presented to me this concept of a modal, to launch at initial login, that would have multiple functionalities:
* Modal to have two main parts; the initial screen and a user-option to slide in screen of "Try Out a Session", where a brief description of a session is described and a trial run could be initiated via download of the application
* The modal needed to contain three cards for the three applications: Desktop, iOS &amp; Android, and RealWear
* Each card to have an image 
* Each card to have Title, benefit pills, bullet list of features and benefits, two with CTAs.
* iOS card to have a slide animation on CTA click, next slide to have QR code and App store buttons for app download
* User could easily dismiss modal if not interested

All of our applications were built in [Lit](https://lit.dev/) which uses the ShadowDOM method. Most styling needed to be encapsulated within the component &mdash; excepting where CSS Properties were called. 

I used CSS `grid` to layout the two states: the responsive view and the wide desktop view. In the responsive view the cards were to take on a stacked landscape orientation, in desktop view, horizontal portrait alingment. The iOS card also needed to adjust its sliding orientation from portrait to landscape.

Once the JavaScript was in place to enable the slider, the next part to be done were the cards with respecitve content and they needed to be responsive per the Figma comps. The completion of this part in the 1st video below:

<div class="video-player" style="padding:105.49% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/943059317?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="Onboarding Modal, Initial Structure"></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>

Next the entire content needed to slide left to reveal the "Try Out a Session" section, revealing an image, marketing copy, app download QR Code and app store buttons, and also be responsive. 

<div class="video-player" style="padding:107.9% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/943059920?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="Onboarding Modal - Try Out a Session Slider"></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>

Finally the iOS and Android card had to individually slide left to reveal an image, marketing copy, app download QR Code and app store buttons, and also be responsive.
<div class="video-player" style="padding:121.36% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/943058024?h=0a536189b0&portrait=0" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>

Success! and a highly functional modal.
