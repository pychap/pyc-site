    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>
      My first job was at age 14 (thanks to help from my dad), in which I helped
      around an Architecture office. As a kid at that time I was interested in
      artistic, creative things. Then here were these people, architects, making
      a living doing this. About all I really did there beyond observing was to
      get in their way. And it didn't last long as a job&mdash;but just being
      there was profound for me.

      This original desire has morphed into digital architecture, leading to
      creating websites.

      Although I've been doing this for years now, I still feel like I
      can&ldquo;t keep up with the pace of changes in the Front-end world. Well,
      I'm comforted in that <i>no one can</i>. I take it all a day at a time and
      thank God that my brain seems to have no limit to what it learns.

      Many development managers consider CSS as a language most developers
      "know". Little do they realize the benefit of having a true CSS
      professional that can write clean, scalable, efficient and manageable
      code, as well as author JavaScript, that's me.

      technologies coupled with JavaScript to build our multiple Augmented
      Reality applications. I worked in LitHTML, Some React, and styled in a
      component environment.
