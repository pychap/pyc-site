      My journey into the professional world started at age 14, thanks to a
      little help from my dad. I found myself in an architecture office,
      captivated by the creativity and craftsmanship of the architects around
      me. While my contributions mostly involved getting in their way ðŸ˜‚, it was
      an eye-opening experience. The idea that people could build a career
      around creating things left a lasting impression on me.

      Over time, that early fascination with design and construction evolved
      into a passion for digital architectureâ€”leading me to build websites.

      Although I&rsquo;ve been a developer for years now, I&rsquo;m always
      amazed by the fast pace of change in the Front-End world. Some days, it
      feels impossible to keep up, but I&rsquo;m comforted knowing no one truly
      can. I take it one step at a time, grateful that my brain seems to have an
      endless capacity to keep learning.

      Many see CSS as a &ldquo;given&rdquo; in a developer&rsquo;s skill set,
      but mastering it is another story. Writing clean, scalable, and efficient
      CSS is an art form, one I&rsquo;ve honed to build seamless digital
      experiences. Coupling that with my proficiency in JavaScript, I take pride
      in delivering maintainable and professional-quality code.

      Most recently, I spent 7 years as a UI Developer at <span

        ><a href="https://www.ptc.com/" target="_blank">PTC Inc</a></span
      >. At Vuforia, I worked with cutting-edge CSS and JavaScript technologies
      to build multiple AR applications. I had the chance to dive into LitHTML,
      React, and component-based styling, blending design and functionality in a
      truly immersive way.

      My background in both Web and Print Design has given me a unique
      perspective on creating digital experiences. I strive for excellence in
      everything I create, ensuring users enjoy a seamless journey through every
      digital interaction.
