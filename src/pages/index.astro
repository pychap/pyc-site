    <p>
      My first job was at age 14 (thanks to help from my dad), I helped around an Architecture office. As a kid at that time I was interested in artistic, creative things. Then here were these people, architects, making a living doing this. About all I really did there beyond observing was to get in their way. And it didn't last long as a job&mdash;but just being there was profound for me.

      I go into greater detail in the About page but suffice to say that this original desire has morphed into digital architecture, leading to creating websites.
