		<h1>Welcome to Front-end <span class="text-gradient">Aesthetic</span></h1>
		<h2>A record of my journey</h2>
		<p>Not sure exactly when, but some time ago I fell in love with Front-end Visual UI development.
		It's a passion that has grown over the years and I feel like the world is my oyster ðŸ¦ª.</p>
		<p>I'm fortunate to work in a company that has mulitple complex enterprise-level applications. </p>
		<p>This website was an awesome experience to build; it had its challenging moments as it is the third or forth iteration.</p>
		<h3>The technologies used:</h3>
		<ul class="list-disc">
			<li><strong>Astro</strong> - if you're at all interested in building websites you <i>must</i> look into the Astro web framework. <a href="https://astro.build/" target="_blank">Here  &rsaquo;</a> </li>
			<li><strong>Design system</strong> - Open Props</li>
			<li><strong>Componentry</strong> (is there such a word ðŸ¤£) - TailwindCSS and Flowbite</li>
			<li>For more CSS fun - <strong>PostCSS</strong> with these plugins:
				<ul class="mt-2">
					<li><code>postcss-custom-media</code></li>
					<li><code>postcss-nesting</code></li>
					<li><code>postcss-preset-env</code> - for any cool new CSS feature not listed above</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>And <strong>JavaScript</strong></li>
		</ul>
