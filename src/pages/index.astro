    <p>
      My first job was at age 14 (thanks to help from my dad), in which I helped around
      an Architecture office. As a kid at that time I was interested in
      artistic, creative things. Then here were these people, architects, making
      a living doing this. About all I really did there beyond observing was to
      get in their way. And it didn't last long as a job&mdash;but just being
      there was profound for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I go into greater detail in the About page but suffice to say that this
      original desire has morphed into digital architecture, leading to creating
      websites.
