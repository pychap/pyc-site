    <h2>Website Architecture</h2>
    <p>
      My first job, thanks to help from my dad, at age 14, was to help around an Architecture office. As a kid at that time I was interested in artistic, creative things. Then here were these people, architects, making a living doing this. About all I really did there beyond observing was to get in their way, and it didn't last long as a job&mdash;but just being there was profound for me.

      I go into greater detail in the About page but suffice to say that this original desire has morphed into digital architecture, leading to creating websites.

          This website was an awesome experience to build; after multiple
          attempts, it feels great to get things off the ground. I'm going to
          write a blog post about it soon so keep checking back!
